   <strong><h3 align="center">How to use</h3></strong>
   <p align="center">Typing ?help ingame will allow you to see all user usable commands! These range from compliments, to betting, to rolling a dice out of 100 against the bot, magic 8 ball implementation, and more to come! Have fun!</p>
   <strong><h3 align="center">About the bot and how to give feedback</h3></strong>
   <p align="center">At the current state of Seclude (mc.seclude.club) - there is minor flaws in the chat format which vastly affect the bot. Tags, ranks, stars. I really hope this could be fixed in a later season of the server.</p>
   <p align="center">And yes, I know GitHub Issues isn't meant to be used this way, but you can give feedback here!</p>
